Minimig Firmware is a shared repository containing bootstrap and OSD firmware
for certain variants of the Minimig project.

Currently the firmware is directly usable with the Turbo Chameleon 64 and
Generic C3 board ports.  The long-term goal is to get M68K (Chameleon/C3),
OR32 (DE1) and ARM (Original Minimig) firmware all buildable from a single
repository which will be used as a git subproject by the toplevel projects.
