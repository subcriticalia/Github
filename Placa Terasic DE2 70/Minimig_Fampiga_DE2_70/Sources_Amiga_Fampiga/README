Fampiga_C3 is a port of the Minimig core to a generic Cyclone III FPGA board.

It's based closely on the Chameleon 64 port by Tobias Gubener, a version of which
can be found in one of my other repositories.  That was itself forked from a version
hosted by Christian Vogelgsang.

While the C3 board port probably won't be much use to other people, since it requires
custom IO boards, I hope ultimately to have a Chameleon version building from the
same source tree.  The C3 board is somewhat easier to develop for than the Chameleon
despite being very similar hardware-wide, so this project is basically intended to be
a testbed for improvements to the core, which I hope to bring back to the Chameleon
as time goes on.

PLEASE NOTE:
The firmware is now stored in a separate repository, which is pulled in using git
submodule support, so if you check out this repo, you will need to issue the
following commands before building:

git submodule init
git submodule update

The Firmware repo contains ready-built .hex files for AmigaBootstrap and OSD_Boot68K,
but if you want to rebuild, there's now a toplevel makefile which supports
"make" and "make clean".
